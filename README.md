# Stop-Hunt Detector — Market Stress Detection System

**Experiment ID:** `f3c1c4d4`  
**Status:** ✅ Day 1 Complete  
**Timebox:** 7 days build + 7 days validate

**Repository:** https://github.com/4everaerial/stop-hunt-detector

## Overview

A Python-based market stress detector that estimates the probability of imminent forced-liquidation/stop-hunt events via a continuous stress score (0.0→1.0) and labeled state output.

**This is NOT a trading bot.** It does not generate buy/sell signals, predict price direction, or execute trades. It measures market stress conditions that often precede forced liquidations.

---

## Core Concept

Stop hunts occur when price briefly spikes to trigger leveraged positions' stop-loss orders, then reverses. These events are characterized by:

1. **Volatility Compression:** Tight trading ranges followed by explosive expansion
2. **Liquidity Fragility:** Order book thinning, large wicks on small volume
3. **Continuation Failure:** Momentum indicators diverge from price action
4. **Speed Asymmetry:** Downward moves are faster/stronger than upward moves

The detector aggregates these signals into a composite stress score (0.0→1.0) and outputs a labeled state.

## Stress Score & States

| Stress Score | State | Interpretation |
|--------------|-------|----------------|
| 0.0 - 0.3 | `NORMAL` | Calm market, no stress indicators |
| 0.3 - 0.6 | `STRESSED` | Moderate compression or fragility |
| 0.6 - 0.8 | `FRAGILE` | Multiple stress conditions present |
| 0.8 - 1.0 | `IMMINENT_CLEARING` | High probability of forced liquidation event |

## Usage

### 1. Fetch Data

```python
from data.fetch_binance import BinanceFetcher

fetcher = BinanceFetcher()
fetcher.fetch_historical('BTCUSDT', '1h', days=365)
```

### 2. Calculate Stress Score

```python
from detector.stress_score import StressCalculator

calculator = StressCalculator()
stress = calculator.calculate_score(df)  # Returns 0.0-1.0
state = calculator.get_state(stress)      # Returns labeled state
```

### 3. Run Full Pipeline

```python
python validation/backtest.py
```

## Validation Plan

**Success Criteria:**

- **Stress Elevation:** ≥70% of events show stress > 0.7 within 1-4 hours before
- **Correlation:** ≥0.3 between stress scores and liquidation events
- **Signal-to-Noise:** Low baseline stress during calm markets (<0.3 average)

**Kill Criteria (Day 7):**

- Correlation < 0.3
- <50% of events show stress elevation
- Stress scores noisy or indiscriminately elevated

---

## Data Sources

- **Primary:** Binance Public API (OHLCV)
- **Pairs:** BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT, etc.
- **Timeframes:** 1h (primary), 15m (high-res validation)
