## Executive Summary

**Total Events Validated:** 1
**Stress Elevation Rate:** 0.0%
**Average Stress Before Events:** 0.637

### Success Criteria

- **Stress Elevation:** ❌ FAIL
- **Low Baseline:** ❌ FAIL

**Overall Result:** ❌ FAILURE

## Methodology

### Stress Signals

The detector measures four market stress signals:

1. **Volatility Compression** - Bollinger Band squeeze + ATR decay
2. **Liquidity Fragility** - Wick-to-body ratio + volume-to-range
3. **Continuation Failure** - RSI/MACD divergence + momentum deceleration
4. **Speed Asymmetry** - Downward vs upward velocity bias

### Stress Score

Composite score (0.0 → 1.0) calculated as weighted sum of signals:

- Volatility: 30%
- Liquidity: 30%
- Continuation: 20%
- Speed: 20%

### State Labels

- **NORMAL** (0.0 - 0.3): Calm market
- **STRESSED** (0.3 - 0.6): Elevated stress
- **FRAGILE** (0.6 - 0.8): Multiple stress conditions
- **IMMINENT_CLEARING** (0.8 - 1.0): High liquidation probability

### Validation Approach

Historical validation against tagged liquidation events:

- Check stress levels 1-4 hours before each event
- Measure stress elevation vs baseline
- Calculate correlation between stress scores and events
- Assess signal-to-noise ratio

## Validation Results

### Event Statistics

- Total events: 1
- Events with pre-event data: 1
- Stress elevation rate: 0.0%

### Stress Metrics

- Average stress at event time: 0.655
- Average pre-event stress: 0.589
- Average pre-event max stress: 0.637

### State Distribution at Events

- FRAGILE: 1 events

## Correlation Analysis

### Stress-Event Correlation

- Pearson: nan (p=nan)
- Spearman: nan (p=nan)

### Stress Elevation

- Baseline stress: 0.606
- Pre-event stress: 0.589
- Elevation: -0.016
- Elevation ratio: 0.97x

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio

- Signal mean (stress > 0.7): 0.741
- Noise mean (stress < 0.7): 0.587
- S/N ratio: 2.979

## Event-by-Event Details

| Event | Time | Severity | Event Stress | Pre-Event Max | Elevated? |
|-------|------|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| Simulated stop hunt event | 2024-02-14 00:00:00 | high | 0.655 | 0.637 | ❌ |

## Conclusions

❌ **Experiment FAILURE**

The stress detector does not meet the validation criteria:
- Stress elevation is insufficient or inconsistent
- Signal-to-noise ratio is poor
- Further refinement is needed

### Next Steps

- Review and refine signal weights
- Consider additional stress signals
- Test on different market conditions
- If criteria met: proceed to real-time monitoring
- If criteria not met: iterate or kill experiment
