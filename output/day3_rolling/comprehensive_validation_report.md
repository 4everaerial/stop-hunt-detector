## Executive Summary

**Total Events Validated:** 13
**Stress Elevation Rate:** 0.0%
**Average Stress Before Events:** 0.659

### Success Criteria

- **Stress Elevation:** ❌ FAIL
- **Low Baseline:** ❌ FAIL

**Overall Result:** ❌ FAILURE

## Methodology

### Stress Signals

The detector measures four market stress signals:

1. **Volatility Compression** - Bollinger Band squeeze + ATR decay
2. **Liquidity Fragility** - Wick-to-body ratio + volume-to-range
3. **Continuation Failure** - RSI/MACD divergence + momentum deceleration
4. **Speed Asymmetry** - Downward vs upward velocity bias

### Stress Score

Composite score (0.0 → 1.0) calculated as weighted sum of signals:

- Volatility: 30%
- Liquidity: 30%
- Continuation: 20%
- Speed: 20%

### State Labels

- **NORMAL** (0.0 - 0.3): Calm market
- **STRESSED** (0.3 - 0.6): Elevated stress
- **FRAGILE** (0.6 - 0.8): Multiple stress conditions
- **IMMINENT_CLEARING** (0.8 - 1.0): High liquidation probability

### Validation Approach

Historical validation against tagged liquidation events:

- Check stress levels 1-4 hours before each event
- Measure stress elevation vs baseline
- Calculate correlation between stress scores and events
- Assess signal-to-noise ratio

## Validation Results

## Conclusions

❌ **Experiment FAILURE**

The stress detector does not meet the validation criteria:
- Stress elevation is insufficient or inconsistent
- Signal-to-noise ratio is poor
- Further refinement is needed

### Next Steps

- Review and refine signal weights
- Consider additional stress signals
- Test on different market conditions
- If criteria met: proceed to real-time monitoring
- If criteria not met: iterate or kill experiment
